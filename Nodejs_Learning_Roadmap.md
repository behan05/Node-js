# Node.js Learning Roadmap

## Part 1: Fundamentals of Node.js

### 1. Understanding Node.js

- What is Node.js? Why use it? (Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model)
- Installing Node.js on your computer.
- Running basic Node.js scripts in the terminal.
- **Modules and require()**: Learn how Node.js uses modules (e.g., `http`, `fs`, `path`) and how to import them using `require()`.

### 2. Core Concepts

- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Installing and managing packages using `npm`.
- **Global objects**: `__dirname`, `__filename`, `process`, `Buffer`.
- **Event-driven nature**: How Node.js uses events and callbacks for asynchronous code.

### 3. Basic I/O Operations

- Working with the **file system** (`fs` module) to read and write files.
- Creating basic **HTTP servers**.
- Handling **request-response**: Creating simple APIs, working with URLs, query strings, and serving files.

## Part 2: Intermediate Concepts

### 1. Asynchronous Programming

- **Callbacks, Promises, and async/await**: How Node.js handles asynchronous code.
- Using `Promises` and `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous code.

### 2. Working with External Data

- **Handling HTTP requests**: Using `axios` or Node.jsâ€™s `http` module to make API requests.
- **Streams**: Reading and writing data in chunks (for large files).
- **Buffering**: Learn how Node.js handles binary data.

### 3. Express Framework

- **Setting up Express**: Installing and configuring Express for building web servers.
- **Routing**: Creating routes for different pages or API endpoints (like `/`, `/about`, `/users`).
- **Middleware**: Understanding and using middleware for tasks like logging, authentication, etc.

### 4. Connecting to Databases

- **Working with databases** like MongoDB or MySQL.
- Using libraries like `mongoose` (for MongoDB) or `sequelize` (for SQL databases).

## Part 3: Advanced Concepts and Deployment

### 1. Advanced Node.js Features

- **Event Emitters**: Creating and managing custom events in Node.js.
- **Streams and Buffers**: Advanced usage of streams for handling large data.
- **Child Processes**: Running system commands and managing sub-processes.

### 2. Authentication and Security

- **User authentication**: Handling user logins, passwords, and sessions using libraries like `passport.js` or JWT.
- **Security**: Protecting your Node.js application from common attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).
- **Environment variables**: Using `dotenv` to securely handle sensitive information.

### 3. Testing and Debugging

- **Testing**: Writing unit tests for your Node.js code using tools like `Mocha`, `Chai`, or `Jest`.
- **Debugging**: Using the built-in debugger or tools like `VS Code` for debugging Node.js code.

### 4. Deploying Your Application

- **Hosting on the Cloud**: Deploying your Node.js app on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
- **Dockerizing your app**: Using Docker to package your Node.js app for consistent deployment.
- **CI/CD**: Setting up automated workflows for deployment using tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, etc.

### Complete Roadmap

- Start with **Part 1** (Basics: modules, file system, HTTP servers).
- Move to **Part 2** (Asynchronous programming, Express framework, and databases).
- Finally, dive into **Part 3** (Advanced concepts, authentication, testing, and deployment).
